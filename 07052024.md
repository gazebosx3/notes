* Some major benefits and changes in React 18
    * Smoother Rendering with Concurrent Mode
        * Rendering is interruptible --- this means UI can respond to user input immediately, even if its in the middle of a larger rendering task. 
    * Automatic batching and transitions
        * React 18 automatically batches state updates within a single render cycle, optimizing performance
            * It does this by breaking up tasks in the main thread, which is a big shift from prior mechanics, where almost all tasks were synchronously executed 
            * useTransition hooks allow devs to ensure certain states will update without blocking the UI
    * React server components 
* Perf gains were particularly important to NYT because they promised significant improvements in INP (interaction to next paint) scores.
    * Important for SEO
* Migration process
    * Remove deprecated Dependencies
    * Foundation setting
        * Upgrade all major deps, types, and tests to conform to react 18 without implementing latest features themselves 
* Tuning on engines
    * Used [createRoot ](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot)and [hydrateRoot](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot)
        * createRoot lets you create a root to display react components inside a browser DOM node
        * hydrateRoot lets you display react components inside a browser DOM node whose HTML content was previously generated by react-dom/server
* Issues
    * They ran into an issue with dangerouslysetinnerhtml
    * Hydration hurdle 
        * Under new rules, any DOM modifications between the initial browser load and client-side hydration trigger a fallback to client-side rendering
            *  TODO: research more about hydration in react 
* Rest of article is on how they fixed problem, seems to be specific to their specific problems re: setting inner html though


# [What is hydration in React? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/18fky3q/what_is_hydration_in_react/)



* Dan Abramov writes it as: “It’s like watering the “dry” HTML with the “water” of interactivity and event handlers.”
* The server sends the client HTML along with a link to the JS to download. The JS gets downloaded and then “hydrates” the page taking it from a plain page to one with interactivity meaning adding handlers to buttons, events to elements on the page like onClick and so forth.
* Browsers typically load HTML and CSS first (top priority), and then as lower priority fetch the JS sources and run them.
* So the first thing you see in a browser is pure rendered HTML and CSS, as it was sent by the server. Sometimes it's the only thing you'll see for multiple seconds or more if your connection is slow / area with bad phone signal.
* So it's usually important to ensure your app looks and works well even when not hydrated ("JS disabled").
