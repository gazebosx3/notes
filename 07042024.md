# [5 Misconceptions about React Server Components](https://www.builder.io/blog/nextjs-react-server-components)



* Server components run only on the server and have on impact on bundle size. Code is never downloaded to clients, reducing bundle size and improving startup time
* Client components are typical components. Have state, effects, access to dDOM, etc
* Misconception 1: Server components should be preferred
    * Server components aren’t suitable for all scenarios, esp those requiring interactivity 
    * Server components are a new type of react component that operates exclusively on the server, fetching data and rendering entirely on the server to improve performance 
* Misconception 2: Something about `use client` and `use server`. Not applicable atm
* Misconception 3: Server components always render on server and client components always render in browser
  

    * Are server components only available in Next.js? 	
    * [Why React Server Components](https://www.builder.io/blog/why-react-server-components)
        * “The goal of this blog post is to guide you through the journey of React’s rendering evolution over the years and help you understand why React Server Components are not just inevitable but also the future of building cost-effective, high-performance React applications that deliver an exceptional user experience.”
        * Gives overview of CSR vs SSR
        * **Hydration**
            * SSR’s approach has complexity re: page’s interacftivity. The full interactivity of the page is on hold until the JS bundle -- React itself, along with app-specific code -- has been completely downloaded and executed by the browser 
            * The phase is called **hydration**, and it’s where the static page is “brought to life”
                * Reactr takes control in the browser, reconstructing the component tree in memory based ont he static html that was served
                * Then, react binds necessary JS logic to these elements. Involved initializing app state, attaching event handlers, etc. 
        * Drawbacks of SSR
            * Components can’t tart rendering and then pause while data is being loaded. If a component needs to fetch data from a database or another source, fetching must be completed before server can begin rendering the page. Initial load fast, but interactivity can take a hit. 
            * Hydration
                * First, all JS for components must be loaded on the client before you can start hydrating them
                * React hydrates component tree in single pass, meaning once it starts it won’t stop and the main thread is blocked 
                    * All or nothing waterfall problem
        * Suspense (in React 18) tries to fix this by unlocking
            * HTML streaming on the server
                * If you wrap part of the page with React Suspense component, we instruct React it does’t need to wait for that section to be fetched to start streaming the HTML for the rest of the page. React will send placeholder like loading spinner
                * For a video see [this](https://cdn.builder.io/o/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F6d186b616e714d26b627c6ffc6585c54%2Fcompressed?apiKey=YJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt&token=6d186b616e714d26b627c6ffc6585c54&alt=media&optimized=true)
            * Selective hydration on the client 
                * While Suspense speeds up initial HTML delivery, client-side app hydration can’t start until all JS is downloaded.
                * To mitigate this, code splitting can be used --- code splitting being when you mark specific code segments as not immediately necessary for loading, signaling your bundler to segregate them into separate &lt;script> tags 
                * React.lazy is how you can do code splitting in react, so that the content inside the &lt;Suspense> is also lazy loaded -- see code example below



        * That being said…browsers still need to download the code for the entire webpage. So that brings us to React Server Components
    * React Server Components
        * This architecture introduces a dual-component model, differentiating between Client Components and Server Components 
            * This distinction is based on _where the components execute an the specific environments they’re designed to interact with _
        * Client Components
            * Basic react components. Typically rendered client-side, but apparently now they can also be rendered to HTML once on the server-side, allowing users to see pages pre-rendered HTML content rather than a blank screen. 
                * Think of them as components that primarily run on the client but can and should also be executed on the server as an optimization strategy 
            * Clint components have access to client _environment_ e.g. browser, allowing them to use state, effects, event listeners, handle interactivity, access browser APIs like geolocation or localStorage 
        * Here’s an example of a client component. 
  

        * Server Components
            * NEW type of react component designed to operate exclusively on the server. Code stays on server and is never downloaded to client. Some benefits are:
            * Zero-bundle sizes
                * Code isn’t sent to clients. Large dependencies can remain server-side, so end users don’t need to download, parse, and execute JS for these components. Also no hydration step
            * Direct access to server-side resources 
                * Server components have more efficient data-fetching and rendering because they have direct access to dbs and filesystems
                    * (are server components…Node…???)
            * Better security, improved data fetching, caching, blah blah blah


# [missing the point of webassembly](https://wingolog.org/archives/2024/01/08/missing-the-point-of-webassembly)



* “I find most descriptions of WebAssembly to be uninspiring: if you start with a phrase like “assembly-like language” or a “virtual machine”, we have already lost the plot. That’s not to say that these descriptions are incorrect, but i**t’s like explaining what a dog is by starting with its circulatory system. You’re not wrong, but you should probably lead with the bark.”**
    * Amazing
* WASM is a new way of dividing computing systems into pieces and of composing systems from parts 
* Lot of stuff about separation of concerns, e.g. when you visit wingolog.org you don’t need to know that it’s Scheme code handling the request and the site doesn’t need to know if the other side of the line is curl or Firefox or whatever. 
* That’s what WASM does: allows systems to interact through a simplified, standarzid interface, facilitating interoperability and modularity 
* Use cases 
    * IoT Devices: WASM provides a wa to enforce software invariants and update software over the air 
    * Function-as-a-Service Cloud: Offers a lightweight, controlled environment for running customer code.
    * Extensible Software: Can replace loadable plug-ins or scripting languages for software extensions, like in GIMP or VS Code.
* WebAssembly is best understood not as just a virtual machine but as a versatile tool for defining clear boundaries within systems, facilitating composition and interoperability. This perspective opens up numerous practical applications and niches where WebAssembly can enhance system design and functionality.


# [How to Annul Promises in JavaScript](https://webdeveloper.beehiiv.com/p/cancel-promises-javascript)


## Method 1: using the new Promise.withResolvers()



* Promise.withResolvers returns an obj containing a new Promise object and two functions to resolve or reject it 


# 


And then

```

const buildCancelableTask = &lt;T>(asyncFn: () => Promise&lt;T>) => {

  let rejected = false;

  const { promise, resolve, reject } = Promise.withResolvers&lt;T>();

  return {

    run: () => {

      if (!rejected) {

        asyncFn().then(resolve, reject);

      }

      return promise;

    },

    cancel: () => {

      rejected = true;

      reject(new Error('CanceledError'));

    },

  };

};

```

Interesting


## Method 2: AbortController



* Better because calling cancel multiple times won’t trigger the abort event more than once 

```

const buildCancelableTask = &lt;T>(asyncFn: () => Promise&lt;T>) => {

  const abortController = new AbortController();

  return {

    run: () =>

      new Promise&lt;T>((resolve, reject) => {

        const cancelTask = () => reject(new Error('CanceledError'));

        if (abortController.signal.aborted) {

          cancelTask();

          return;

        }

        asyncFn().then(resolve, reject);

        abortController.signal.addEventListener('abort', cancelTask);

      }),

    cancel: () => {

      abortController.abort();

    },

  };

};

```
